4.  My experiences are concrete and quantitative.

## Experience

1.  What have I learned and accomplished?
2.  Why does it matter?
3.  How does it make me a good fit for the institution?

## Program

The University of Chicago has a long tradition of innovative research in the
neurosciences. This tradition is continued in the Graduate Program in
Computational Neuroscience, which provides an interdepartmental and
interdivisional focus on innovative multidisciplinary training in neuroscience.

1.  Which professors do I want to work with?
2.  Do I have proposals for projects or research directions?

## Paragraphs

1.  I wish to pursue a PhD to study how the brain transforms input to output
    focusing on organization and computation.
2.  I did not want to go to graduate school until I completed my honors thesis;
    I have an academic background spanning many fields.
    1.  I learned of my passion to conduct research; I learned how to approach
        questions from multiple perspectives in a rigorous manner.
    2.  I am motivated to conduct research; I have atypical experience and
        perspective.
    3.  I approach neuroscience in a multidisciplinary fashion.
3.  I joined the laboratory of Dr. Stephen Van Hooser at Brandeis University; I
    studied the tuning of neurons in the primary visual cortex (V1).
    1.  I learned to adapt computational techniques to analyze neural data; I
        learned to construct code that prevented model fits from ending up in
        local error minima; I learned to monitor the progression of data through
        a pipeline to ensure the process produces quality output; I learned
        technical writing.
    2.  I can program; I possess computational skills others may not; I have
        experience writing scientific papers.
    3.  I have a strong computational background; I can improve processing
        methods to answer scientific questions.
4.  I joined the laboratory of Dr. Bevil Conway at the National Eye Institute
    (NEI); I first worked on a project investigating the association between
    color and shape; I currently lead a project assessing the functional
    properties of retinotopic visual cortex.
    1.  I learned to work alongside humans and animals; I learned how to conduct
        experimental and computational research; I learned an experimental
        method; I learned the importance of teamwork and interdivisional
        communication; I learned the steps required to launch a project; I
        learned to effectively communicate my scientific work.
    2.  I have relevant experience; I can work with others; I can lead a
        project; I can design experiments and analysis pipelines; I understand
        the importance of collaboration; I understand the science behind my
        work.
    3.  I can do experimental and computational research; I actively seek
        scientific collaborations; I can effectively push research forward; I
        understand the requirements of conducting research full-time.
5.  I have lead two journal clubs; I am involved in multiple committees,
    organizing conferences, retreats, and journal clubs; I helped teach basic
    programming to researchers.
    1.  I learned to communicate science outside my immediate field; I learned
        to lead group discussions; I learned to organize and communicate
        promptly; I learned to communicate complex concepts succinctly.
    2.  I have leadership experience; I possess organizational skills; I have
        teaching experience.
    3.  I will be an active member of the neuroscience community.
6.  I believe UChicago is an excellent fit for me to pursue a PhD.
    1.  I wish to work with David Freedman, Marlene Cohen, John Maunsell,
        Matthew Kaufman, and Ramon Nogueira.
    2.  I am interested in working with Marlene Cohen, David Freedman, or John
        Maunsell to possibly study how subcortical structures interact with
        visual areas while attending to stimuli or making a decision; I am
        interested in working with John Maunsell and Matthew Kaufman to study
        the interaction of visual and motor cortex work together in coordinating
        behavior; I am interested in working alongside Ramon Nogueira to define
        theoretical models of interactions across the brain to inform the
        development of biologically-inspired neural networks.
